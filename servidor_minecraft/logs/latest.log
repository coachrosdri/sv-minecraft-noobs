[02:08:31] [ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3/WARN]: Mod platforms_common uses the version unspecified which isn't compatible with Loader's extended semantic version format (Could not parse version number component 'unspecified'!), SemVer is recommended for reliably evaluating dependencies and prioritizing newer version
